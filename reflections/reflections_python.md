### Reflections on the Altair Dashboard
This is our reflections document. Please add any thoughts as you have them. We will combine the thoughts on Saturday. 

"In this section, you should (as a group) critique your dashboard and point out what it does well, what its limitations are, and what are good future improvements and additions. In this section, you should also clearly document how you addressed the feedback (GitHub issues) you received from your peers and the TAs. Point form is fine, but they need to be full sentences. This section should not be more than 500 words."
