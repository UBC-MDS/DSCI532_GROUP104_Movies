### Reflections on the Altair Dashboard

Our dashboard does well in letting the users interact with the various directors for a given genre. We kept the dashboard simple to make it more effective in looking at the plots and filters available while still answering our research questions. The bar plot was chosen to show the relationship between the directors and number of movies for users to identify potential directors to compare. This plot answers our first research question on the top 50 most productive directors for a given genre. The line charts for "IMDB Ratings" and "Worldwide Profits" were chosen to show the different movies and their respective ratings and profits over time answering our research questions on what the profits and ratings for a specific director are. The interactivity between the most productive directors’ chart and the other charts, gives the user the flexibility to choose the directors that are of interest to them. Our app allows multiple selection which allows the comparison of as many directors as the user wants. 

We took Ellen's feedback to not include the movie list as it would've been a lot of movies and text plotted. We instead re-arranged our prototype to focus on the graphs that better conveyed and answered our research questions. We also made sure to include our progress and roles in GitHub issues.

There are quite features we wish we could have added or refined if we had more time. We made the most productive directors’ chart interactive to filter our rating and profit charts. However, since the rating and profit charts rely on the selection of the most productive directors’ chart, we wanted to be able to pre-select 1-2 directors when the dashboard loaded. We can pre-select a director in a Jupyter notebook, but unfortunately, we cannot reproduce the pre-selection effect in the dashboard, which leads to an overplotted ratings and profit line chart upon loading the dashboard. These initial charts of many coloured lines are not an effective visualization. Besides, the legend of the rating and profit charts is truncated after translating Altair plots to HTML. We have been [in touch with Jake Vanderplas from Altair](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies/issues/49) to discuss implementation to achieve our goals with these features.
