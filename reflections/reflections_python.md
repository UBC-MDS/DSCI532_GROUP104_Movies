### Reflections on the Altair Dashboard

Our dashboard does well in letting the users interact with the various directors for a given genre. We kept the dashboard simple to make it more effective in looking at the plots and filters available while still answering our research questions. We didn't want to overwhelm the user with a lot of features and charts. The interactivity between the most productive directors chart and the other charts, gives the user the flexibility to choose the directors that are of interest to them to produce their next movie. Our app allows multiple selection which allows the comparison of as many directors as the user wants. 

We took Ellen's feedback to not include the movie list as it would've been a lot of movies and text plotted. We instead re-arranged our prototype to focus on the graphs that better conveyed and answered our research questions. We also made sure to include our progress and roles in GitHub issues.

There are quite features we wish we could have added or refined if we had more time. We made the most productive directors chart interactive to filter our rating and profit charts. However, since the rating and profit charts rely on the selection of the most productive directors chart we wanted to be able to pre-select 1-2 directors when the dashboard loaded. We can pre-select a director in a Jupyter notebook, but unfortunately, we cannot reproduce the pre-selection effect in the dashboard, which leads to an overplotted ratings and profit line chart upon loading the dashboard. These initial charts of many coloured lines are not an effective visualization. We have been [in touch with Jake Vanderplas from Altair](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies/issues/49) to discuss implementation to achieve our goals with these two features.
