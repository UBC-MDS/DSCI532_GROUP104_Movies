### 1. Motivation and Purpose

Investing in the movie business is like gambling: it may sound glamorous but can be very risky. People sink billions into the movie business each year, fancied by the glam of movies. But most movies lose money according to a recent post [1]. This year, Disney alone announced a 170 million USD loss after X-Men: Dark Phoenix [2]. Investors should calm down and study the movie market before diving into the business. Knowing more about the directors' reputation and experience, Investors can make better decisions on their investments. To help investors choose the best candidate directors, we propose creating a data visualization app to organize and visualize the facts of directors. With our app, the investor can select a movie genre to find out the top 50 experienced directors of that genre in a given time frame, and then review and compare individual director's statistics by filtering.
