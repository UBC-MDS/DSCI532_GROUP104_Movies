The landing page of the app contains a bar chart of the top 50 productive directors, a list of movies, two scatter plots showing the rates and profits of a specific movie across years. From a dropdown list, users can filter out variables from the bar chart display by genres(i.e. Drama), and by time range(i.e. 1990-2000). They can also choose the diretors they would like to explore for the list of movies, the scatter charts showing the ratings and profits of that director's movies. Users can compare the ratings and profits of movies from different directors they choose by scrolling down through the app interface.
