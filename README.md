# DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies

### Visualization App Purpose
Our proposed project is a data visualization app. Investors and researchers can select a movie genre to find out the top 50 experienced directors of that genre in a given time frame, and then review and compare individual director's statistics by filtering. The full proposal can be found in [our proposal file](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies/blob/master/proposal.md).

### App Description 
The landing page of the app contains a bar chart of the top 30 most productive directors, and two scatter plots showing the ratings and profits of movies of these 30 directors across the years. With the genre dropdown menu, users can define the genre (i.e. Drama) to visualize the top 30 most productive directors in the bar chart. Users can click on the bar representing the director in the bar chart to explore and get the corresponding scatter charts showing ratings and profits related to the movies of the selected director. Besides users can choose multiple directors and compare movie ratings and profits from different directors by clicking on multiple bars.
