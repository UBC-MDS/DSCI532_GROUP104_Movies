# DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies

### Visualization App Purpose
Our proposed project is a data visualization app. Investors and researchers can select a movie genre to find out the top 30 experienced directors of that genre in a given time frame, and then review and compare individual director's statistics by filtering. The full proposal can be found in [our proposal file](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies/blob/master/proposal.md).

### App Description 
The landing page of the app contains a bar chart of the top 30 most productive directors, and two scatter plots showing the ratings and profits of movies of these 30 directors across the years. With the genre dropdown menu, users can define the genre (i.e. Drama) to visualize the top 30 most productive directors in the bar chart. Users can click on the bar representing the director in the bar chart to explore and get the corresponding scatter charts showing ratings and profits related to the movies of the selected director. Besides users can choose multiple directors and compare movie ratings and profits from different directors by clicking on multiple bars. You can find the deployed app here: [Directors Production Tracker](https://directors-production-track-app.herokuapp.com).

### APP Functionality
First, users can choose any genre they are interested by the Dropdown Menu`Genres`. After one genre is chosen, users can see top 30 most productive directors from 1960 to 2010 in that genre. Then users can click on any bar representing a specific director to see the performance (ratings and profits) of his movies. If users want to make comparison between different directors, they can choose multiple directors by `shift+click` on corresponding bars. The plots `Ratings` and `Profits` will show the grouped lines visualizing the performance of their movies. Besides, when users hover the pointer over a data point, without clicking it, a tooltip will appear â€” a small "hover box" with information(title, director, genre,ratings and profits) about the movie being hovered over.
