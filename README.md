# DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies

### Visualization App Purpose
Our proposed project is a visualization app for investors and researchers can select a movie genre to find out the top 50 experienced directors of that genre in a given time frame, and then review and compare individual director's statistics by filtering. The full proposal can be found in [our proposal file](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies/blob/master/proposal.md).

### App Description 
The landing page of the app contains a bar chart of the top 50 productive directors, a list of movies, two scatter plots showing the rates and profits of a specific movie across the years. With the genre dropdown menu and the time slider, users can define the genre (i.e. Drama) and the time frame (i.e. 1990-2000) to visualize the top 50 productive directors in the bar chart. Users can choose a director to explore and get the director's movie list and scatter charts showing ratings and profits related to the listed movies. Besides users can choose multiple directors and compare movie ratings and profits from different directors by scrolling down through the app interface.
